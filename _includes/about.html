	<div class="about-text">
		<p><strong>I'm excited to continue a career in software engineering.</strong> I've had a hand in all parts of the development process from database management, to web design and love being a full stack developer. Most of my work has been done in Typescript using React for the frontend and C++ on the back. I've had some experience with Node.js, MeteorJs, and Ruby on Rails too. In my free time I love to draw and paint, play video games like Fallout and play with my cats, Lady and Marbles. If you're interested in hiring a new software engineer or just want to learn more about my work, have a look around, I'm happy to have you!</p>
